* [Events]()

## Types

*There are no types in this module.*

## Commands

Each command is a generator function. The return
type `Generator[x, y, z]` indicates that the generator
*yields* arguments of type `x`, it must be resumed with
an argument of type `y`, and it returns type `z`. In
this library, types `x` and `y` are the same for all
commands, and `z` is the return type you should pay attention
to. For more information, see
[Getting Started: Commands](../../readme.md#getting-started-commands).

### disable()

Disables inspector domain notifications.

### enable()

Enables inspector domain notifications.

## Events

Generally, you do not need to instantiate CDP events
yourself. Instead, the API creates events for you and then
you use the event’s attributes.
